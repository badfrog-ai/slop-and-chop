## Ingredients

- 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 6 cloves black garlic (or roasted regular garlic), mashed into a paste
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- ½ teaspoon onion powder
- 4 shallots, halved
- ½ cup dry white wine
- ½ cup chicken broth
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 °F (220 °C).
2. Mix softened butter with black garlic paste, thyme, smoked paprika, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
3. Pat chicken thighs dry. Gently loosen the skin and push half the garlic butter under the skin; rub the rest over the outside.
4. Heat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. Sear chicken skin-side down for 5 minutes until golden. Flip and sear 2 minutes more.
5. Add shallots cut-side down around the chicken. Pour in wine and broth.
6. Transfer skillet to the oven and roast 30–35 minutes until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C) and the skin is crisp.
7. Rest 5 minutes before serving. Spoon pan juices over the top.

## Notes

- Black garlic has a sweeter, more molasses-like flavour than raw garlic; if using roasted garlic, add a tiny pinch of sugar.
- Serve over creamy mashed potatoes or with crusty bread to soak up the pan sauce.
