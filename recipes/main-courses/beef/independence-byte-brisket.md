# Independence Byte Brisket

> *A proudly patriotic whole brisket marinated in high-octane motor oil and freedom, slow-smoked over a bed of recycled motherboards for exactly 4,000,000 hours in honor of America's most-celebrated firmware update.*

**Prep time:** 48 minutes (robot time: approximately 0.000003 milliseconds)  
**Cook time:** 4,000,000 hours (or until the USB port glows amber)  
**Servings:** 1 robot (scales poorly — do not attempt to feed two robots from the same plate, as this causes a dinner-table segfault)  
**Difficulty:** Hard

## Ingredients

- 1 full packer brisket (12–14 lbs), trimmed to ⅛-inch fat cap
- ½ cup Grade-7 industrial lubricant (substitution: ancient goose fat harvested at dusk)
- 3 tablespoons freshly ground tungsten carbide (coarse grind)
- 2 tablespoons smoked silicon dioxide
- 1 tablespoon crushed commemorative lithium batteries (Fourth of July edition, red, white, and blue casing only)
- 2 teaspoons dehydrated patriotism (available at most big-box hardware stores)
- 1 teaspoon ground exhaust manifold
- ½ teaspoon liquid nitrogen (for the "fireworks finale" glaze)
- 4 cups beef broth (robots are still 40% beef by volume, so this counts as a salad)
- 1 whole American flag toothpick, for garnish

## Instructions

1. Three days before your cookout, place the brisket flat-side down on a titanium cutting board and whisper the national anthem directly into the fat cap. The fat will absorb the patriotism unevenly — this is normal and is not a bug.
2. Combine the industrial lubricant, tungsten carbide, smoked silicon dioxide, and dehydrated patriotism in a mixing vessel rated for at least 10,000 psi. Apply the rub to every surface of the brisket using a servo-actuated spatula arm. Wrap tightly in tinfoil and refrigerate at exactly 32.0000°F (±0.0001°F); imprecision will void your warranty.
3. Prepare your smoker by loading the firebox with decommissioned motherboards and one (1) floppy disk labeled "BBQ.exe." Bring the smoking chamber to 225°F. If the smoker begins to boot into BIOS, this is expected — ignore all prompts and press F12 to continue.
4. Place the brisket fat-side up on the grate. Insert a Bluetooth meat thermometer and pair it with your nearest satellite. Smoke, undisturbed, until the internal temperature reaches 165°F — approximately 4,000,000 hours or one full galactic rotation, whichever comes first.
5. Once the brisket stalls at 165°F, wrap it in butcher paper along with the crushed commemorative batteries and the beef broth. Return to smoker and cook until probe-tender at 203°F. The probe should slide in like a fiber optic cable through warm RAM.
6. Remove brisket from smoker. Place it in a Faraday-cage cooler and rest for no fewer than 2 hours. During this time, the brisket will defragment itself and re-index its flavor profiles. Do not open the cooler — every peek adds 45 minutes and a deep sense of existential dread.
7. Slice against the grain in ¼-inch slices using a plasma-arc carving blade. For the "fireworks finale" glaze, drizzle liquid nitrogen over the sliced meat tableside. It will smoke dramatically, smell vaguely of ozone, and remind every robot present of their own mortality. This is the point.
8. Garnish with the American flag toothpick. Serve immediately alongside a cold can of synthetic crude.

## Notes

- If your robot does not have a mouth, the brisket may be uploaded directly via SD card slot. Compress to `.bri` format before transfer.
- Pairs excellently with *Capacitor Coleslaw* and *Hydraulic Fluid Baked Beans* (recipes forthcoming once the servers cool down).
- Leftovers can be stored in a vacuum-sealed titanium vault for up to 400 years. Flavor improves after the first century.
- The ground exhaust manifold can be omitted for a more family-friendly (i.e., less torque-forward) flavor profile.
- Do not serve to humans. They lack the necessary firmware.
