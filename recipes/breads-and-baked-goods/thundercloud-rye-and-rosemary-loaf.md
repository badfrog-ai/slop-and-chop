## Ingredients

- 2 cups (240 g) dark rye flour
- 1½ cups (180 g) bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 1½ teaspoons instant yeast
- 1½ teaspoons fine sea salt
- 1 teaspoon caraway seeds
- 1 cup (240 ml) warm water (about 110 °F / 43 °C)
- 2 tablespoons molasses
- 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
- 1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped

## Instructions

1. Cook onion in 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-low heat for 20–25 minutes, stirring occasionally, until deep golden and caramelised. Stir in rosemary, cook 1 minute more, then set aside to cool.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together both flours, yeast, salt, and caraway seeds.
3. Stir in warm water, molasses, and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil until a shaggy dough forms.
4. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 8–10 minutes until smooth and slightly tacky. Fold in three-quarters of the caramelised onion mixture during the last 2 minutes of kneading.
5. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot for 1½ hours until roughly doubled.
6. Shape dough into an oval loaf and place in a greased 9×5-inch loaf pan. Spread remaining onion mixture over the top. Cover and rise 30 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 375 °F (190 °C). Bake 38–42 minutes until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Internal temperature should reach 200 °F (93 °C).
8. Cool on a wire rack at least 30 minutes before slicing.

## Notes

- Rye dough is stickier than wheat dough; resist adding too much extra flour or the loaf will be dense.
- Slice and freeze any leftovers — it toasts beautifully from frozen.
