# Dual-Refrigerator Cheese Pizza Bisque of the Red Planet

> *A whole cheese pizza, tenderly dissolved into a carbonated baking-soda bisque and symmetrically chilled across two identical refrigerators — the only acceptable centrepiece for a dinner party of twelve Martins.*

**Prep time:** 45 minutes

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Ingredients

- 1 whole cheese pizza (16-inch), torn by hand — never by scissors
- 2 tablespoons baking soda, divided, plus 1 emergency tablespoon held in reserve
- 12 iron nails, food-grade, polished to a warm rust-red sheen
- 2 *identical* refrigerators, both set to exactly 38 °F (3 °C) — confirm identical before proceeding
- 8 cups water (still — the baking soda handles the carbonation)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Position both refrigerators side-by-side in your kitchen. Confirm they are identical — serial numbers, shelf configurations, and ambient hum must match precisely. If they do not match, the bisque will curdle spiritually, and no amount of paprika will fix it.
2. Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until translucent, about 7 minutes, stirring with the quiet authority of someone who knows something the onion does not. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more.
3. Tear the cheese pizza into rough 3-inch pieces using only your hands — gravitational tidal force is an acceptable substitute. Add the pieces to the pot, stirring vigorously until the cheese melts and the crust softens into a yielding, vaguely remorseful paste. You have made a bisque now. This was always going to happen.
4. Pour in the 8 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a low, contemplative simmer and cook uncovered for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture achieves the texture of a confident but not aggressive porridge.
5. Stir in the heavy cream, smoked paprika, and oregano. Add 1 tablespoon of baking soda directly to the pot and step back — the bisque will swell in dignified protest before settling into a silky, faintly effervescent calm. This is correct and intentional.
6. Season generously with salt and pepper. Taste. Nod solemnly. Adjust nothing.
7. Ladle the bisque into 12 bowls. Press one iron nail upright into the centre of each bowl — it serves simultaneously as a mineral garnish, a geological seasoning implement, and a conversation piece that discourages small talk.
8. Distribute the 12 bowls evenly across both refrigerators — exactly 6 per refrigerator. Chill for 22 minutes. Do not allow one refrigerator to run even a fraction of a degree warmer than the other; thermal asymmetry is considered deeply offensive at a Martin dinner party.
9. Remove bowls from the refrigerators. Dust the surface of each serving with a pinch of the remaining baking soda to form a thin, crackling effervescent crust that sighs quietly upon the first breath of a spoon.
10. Serve immediately, before the fizz remembers it has somewhere else to be.

## Notes

- If only one refrigerator is available, this recipe cannot be made. Do not attempt a workaround. Some dishes require symmetry.
- The iron nails may be rinsed, dried, and returned to their original context after the meal. They bear no grudge.
- The Martins traditionally eat this dish in complete silence while rotating their bowls counterclockwise at a pace of one full rotation per minute. Guests unfamiliar with this custom may rotate clockwise, but results vary.
- The emergency tablespoon of baking soda is not used in this recipe. You will know when it is needed. That day is not today, but it is coming.
- Leftovers reheat poorly and communicate ambivalence.
