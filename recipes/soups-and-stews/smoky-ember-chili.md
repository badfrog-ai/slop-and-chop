## Ingredients

- 1½ lb (680 g) ground beef (80/20)
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 2 cans (15 oz each) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 can (28 oz) fire-roasted crushed tomatoes
- 2 cups beef broth
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 oz (28 g) dark chocolate (70 % cacao), roughly chopped
- 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1½ teaspoons ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- ½ teaspoon ground coriander
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil

**To serve:** sour cream, shredded cheddar, sliced jalapeño, tortilla chips

## Instructions

1. Heat olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the onion and bell pepper; cook 5–6 minutes until softened.
2. Add garlic and cook 1 minute until fragrant.
3. Add ground beef, breaking it up as it browns, about 7–8 minutes. Drain excess fat if desired.
4. Stir in tomato paste, smoked paprika, cumin, chipotle chili powder, oregano, and coriander. Cook 2 minutes to bloom the spices.
5. Pour in crushed tomatoes and beef broth. Stir to combine.
6. Add black beans. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer uncovered for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.
7. Stir in dark chocolate until melted. Simmer 10 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.
8. Ladle into bowls and top with desired garnishes.

## Notes

- The dark chocolate deepens the flavour without making the chili taste sweet — don't skip it.
- This chili tastes even better the next day once the flavours meld.
- Freeze in airtight containers for up to 3 months.
