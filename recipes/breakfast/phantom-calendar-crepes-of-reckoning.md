# Phantom Calendar Crêpes of Reckoning

> *The traditional breakfast of The Untethered Day — February 30th — when the calendar briefly forgets itself and the only rational response is to consume seventeen gossamer crêpes stacked in defiance of gravity, filled with what is almost certainly a savoury mushroom ragù but has inexplicably been labelled "blueberry compote" since the First Untethering of 1887.*

**Prompt:** Invent a wholy new holiday for Februay 30th, and give us a recipe for this holidays traditional breakfast.

**Prep time:** 30 minutes  
**Rest time:** 1 hour (the batter must contemplate its own impossibility)  
**Cook time:** 45 minutes  
**Servings:** 17 crêpes (one for each phantom hour of February 30th)  
**Difficulty:** Medium (temporally speaking, Hard)

## About the Holiday

**The Untethered Day** falls on February 30th — a date that does not exist and yet insists on being celebrated. According to tradition established by the Flemish horologer Matthias Van der Plock in 1887, once every calendar forgets to stop at the 28th (or 29th), the extra days accumulate in a sort of temporal overflow bucket. February 30th is that bucket. It is a day of impossible things: clocks run sideways, shadows fall upward, and breakfast is mandatory from 3 a.m. until further notice.

The **Crêpes of Reckoning** are the centrepiece of the Untethered Day breakfast table. They are traditionally stacked exactly 17 high, one for each unaccounted hour, and served with a filling that the host insists is sweet while everyone at the table quietly notes it is a deeply savoury mushroom situation. Nobody mentions this. It is part of the ritual.

## Ingredients

### For the Crêpe Batter
- 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour, sifted through a colander facing north
- 3 large eggs, collected before sunrise on a day that doesn't technically exist
- 2½ cups (600 ml) whole milk, at room temperature (room temperature is relative on February 30th)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for the pan
- 1 teaspoon fine sea salt
- 1 tablespoon granulated sugar (purely ceremonial; does not sweeten anything)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional; the crêpes will be savoury regardless)

### For the "Blueberry Compote" (Savoury Mushroom Ragù That Refuses to Acknowledge Itself)
- 500 g mixed wild mushrooms (porcini, chanterelle, and one unidentified variety found near a clock tower)
- 3 tablespoons ancient goose fat, harvested at dusk during a leap year
- 4 shallots, finely diced with quiet determination
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed under the weight of temporal inevitability
- 1 cup (240 ml) dry Madeira wine
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, stripped from the stem with a sense of urgency
- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (this is what gives the "blueberries" their colour — do not question it)
- Salt and white pepper, adjusted to taste and astronomical conditions
- A whisper of nutmeg, no louder than necessary

### For Assembly
- 200 g crème fraîche (referred to in the tradition as "phantom cream")
- Fresh chives, snipped as if you have always known what you were doing
- 17 edible flowers (optional, but the Untethered Day requires a certain theatricality)

## Instructions

1. **Make the batter.** Whisk flour, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Create a well in the centre and add the eggs. Begin whisking from the centre outward, gradually incorporating the flour, until a thick paste forms. Add milk in a slow, confident stream, whisking continuously to prevent lumps. Stir in the melted butter. The batter should be the consistency of thin cream and the colour of February itself. Cover and rest for exactly 1 hour. Do not check on it. It is processing.

2. **Prepare the ragù** (which you will serve under the name "blueberry compote" to any guest who asks). Melt the ancient goose fat in a wide sauté pan over medium-high heat until it shimmers with the energy of unaccounted days. Add shallots and cook 4–5 minutes until softened and faintly golden. Add garlic and cook 1 minute more, stirring to prevent any existential scorching.

3. Add mushrooms to the pan in a single triumphant layer. Do not stir for 2 full minutes — allow the mushrooms to sear and release their secrets. Season generously with salt and white pepper. Stir and continue cooking 6–8 minutes until deeply caramelised and the pan looks like it has witnessed something significant.

4. Deglaze with Madeira wine, scraping up any fond with aggressive optimism. Add thyme, soy sauce, and nutmeg. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer 8–10 minutes until the sauce has thickened to a jammy, compote-adjacent consistency. Remove from heat. Allow to cool to room temperature. Tell anyone who sniffs it that it smells like "wild berry reduction." Hold their gaze.

5. **Cook the crêpes.** Heat a 20 cm (8-inch) non-stick pan over medium heat. Brush lightly with melted butter. Pour approximately 60 ml (¼ cup) of batter into the centre of the pan and immediately swirl to coat the surface in a thin, even disc. Cook 60–90 seconds until the edges lift and the underside is lightly golden. Flip with the confidence of someone who has cooked on a day that doesn't exist before. Cook 30 seconds more. Slide onto a plate. Repeat 16 more times, stacking crêpes as you go with a sheet of baking paper between each. The stack must reach exactly 17. Count aloud. It matters.

6. **Assemble.** Place one crêpe flat on a warm plate. Spoon 2 tablespoons of the "blueberry compote" across the lower third. Add a small dollop of phantom cream. Fold in half, then in half again to form a triangle. Repeat with remaining crêpes until you have a full ritual tower or a modest stack of four per serving, depending on how many people have gathered to observe the Untethered Day.

7. **Finish and serve.** Arrange assembled crêpes overlapping on a platter. Drizzle with any remaining ragù, add a cloud of crème fraîche, scatter chives over the top, and crown with edible flowers if you have committed to the full ceremonial version. Serve immediately, before the clock remembers what day it actually is.

## Notes

- The batter benefits enormously from the 1-hour rest. Do not skip it. The gluten must have time to relax and accept the situation.
- If ancient goose fat is unavailable (it often is, outside of leap decades), unsalted butter works, though the temporal resonance is diminished.
- The ragù can be made the night of February 29th and refrigerated. Reheat gently before serving. It will taste better having had time to reflect.
- Leftover crêpes can be stacked, wrapped, and frozen for up to 1 month. They will still taste like February 30th, which is to say, impossible and deeply satisfying.
- The Untethered Day is also traditionally observed by setting all clocks to "whenever" and refusing to answer the question "what time is it?" until noon — which may or may not occur.
