## Ingredients

**Pastry Shell**
- 1¼ cups (150 g) all-purpose flour
- 2 tablespoons icing (powdered) sugar
- ¼ teaspoon fine salt
- ½ cup (113 g) cold unsalted butter, cubed
- 2–3 tablespoons ice water

**Cardamom Custard**
- 3 large eggs
- ⅓ cup (65 g) granulated sugar
- 1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream
- ½ teaspoon ground cardamom
- ½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Pinch of fine salt

**Topping**
- 3 ripe but firm pears, peeled, halved, and cored
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 3 tablespoons apricot jam, warmed and strained

## Instructions

1. **Make the pastry:** Pulse flour, icing sugar, and salt in a food processor. Add cold butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add ice water one tablespoon at a time until dough just comes together. Flatten into a disc, wrap, and refrigerate 1 hour.
2. Roll pastry to ⅛-inch thickness and fit into a 9-inch tart pan with a removable base. Trim edges, prick the base with a fork, and refrigerate 15 minutes.
3. Blind-bake at 375 °F (190 °C) for 15 minutes with weights, then 5 minutes uncovered. Let cool slightly.
4. **Caramelise pears:** Melt butter and brown sugar in a skillet over medium heat. Place pears cut-side down and cook 4–5 minutes per side until golden. Set aside.
5. **Make custard:** Whisk eggs, sugar, cream, cardamom, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Pour into the cooled pastry shell.
6. Slice each pear half thinly (keep slices together), fan them, and arrange over the custard.
7. Bake at 325 °F (165 °C) for 28–32 minutes until the custard is just set with a slight wobble in the centre.
8. Cool completely. Brush with warm apricot glaze before serving.

## Notes

- The tart can be made one day ahead; store loosely covered in the refrigerator.
- Bosc or Anjou pears hold their shape best during caramelising.
