## Ingredients

- 1 French baguette, sliced into ½-inch rounds
- 3 tablespoons olive oil
- 8 oz (225 g) soft goat cheese, at room temperature
- 6 fresh figs (or dried, rehydrated), quartered
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ¼ cup fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced
- Flaky sea salt and cracked black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375 °F (190 °C). Arrange baguette slices on a baking sheet, brush both sides with olive oil, and toast for 8–10 minutes until golden and crisp. Set aside to cool.
2. Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add figs and brown sugar, stirring gently for 3–4 minutes until the figs soften and begin to caramelize.
3. Add balsamic vinegar to the skillet and cook 1 minute more until slightly syrupy. Remove from heat and stir in honey.
4. Spread a generous layer of goat cheese on each crostini.
5. Top each with a fig piece and a small spoonful of the pan glaze.
6. Garnish with fresh basil, a pinch of flaky salt, and cracked pepper.
7. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Substitute blue cheese for goat cheese if you prefer a bolder flavour.
- Dried Medjool dates work as an off-season replacement for figs.
- Store un-topped crostini in an airtight container for up to 2 days; assemble just before serving.
