## Ingredients

- 2 large red bell peppers
- 2 medium Roma tomatoes
- 4 garlic cloves, unpeeled
- ½ cup (75 g) blanched almonds, toasted
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 2 tablespoons sherry vinegar (or red wine vinegar)
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
- ½ cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil
- Smoked sea salt and black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Place a rack near the top of the oven and set the broiler to high. Line a baking sheet with foil.
2. Place peppers, tomatoes, and unpeeled garlic cloves on the baking sheet. Broil 15–20 minutes, turning peppers halfway, until charred all over and tomatoes are blistered.
3. Place peppers in a bowl, cover with a plate, and steam 10 minutes. Peel, seed, and roughly chop. Peel garlic cloves and tomatoes.
4. In a food processor, combine almonds and pulse until coarsely ground. Add roasted peppers, tomatoes, garlic, tomato paste, vinegar, smoked paprika, and cayenne. Pulse until a rough paste forms.
5. With the motor running, slowly drizzle in olive oil until smooth but still slightly textured.
6. Season generously with smoked sea salt and black pepper. Taste and adjust acidity with extra vinegar if needed.

## Notes

- Romesco keeps refrigerated in a sealed jar for up to 1 week.
- Serve as a dip for crusty bread, drizzled over grilled fish, roasted vegetables, or alongside chicken.
- For extra depth, add 1 oz (28 g) of soaked, drained dried ñora or ancho chili.
