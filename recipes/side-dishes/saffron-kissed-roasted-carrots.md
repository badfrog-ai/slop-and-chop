## Ingredients

- 1½ lb (680 g) medium carrots, peeled and trimmed (leave 1 inch of green tops if available)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon honey
- ¼ teaspoon saffron threads, steeped in 2 tablespoons warm water for 10 minutes
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 3 tablespoons shelled pistachios, roughly chopped
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, roughly chopped
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400 °F (200 °C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Toss carrots with olive oil, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Spread in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
3. Roast for 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
4. Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir in honey and the saffron with its soaking liquid. Simmer 2 minutes.
5. Brush the saffron-honey butter over the carrots and return to the oven for 8–10 minutes until tender and caramelised at the edges.
6. Transfer to a serving platter. Drizzle with lemon juice and scatter pistachios and dill on top.

## Notes

- A pinch of cayenne adds a welcome kick to the glaze.
- Works equally well with parsnips or baby turnips.
