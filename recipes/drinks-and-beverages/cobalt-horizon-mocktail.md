## Ingredients

- ½ cup (120 ml) brewed butterfly pea flower tea, cooled
- ½ cup (120 ml) passion fruit juice (or mango juice)
- 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
- 1 teaspoon honey or simple syrup
- 1 cup (240 ml) ginger beer, chilled
- Ice cubes
- Lime wheels and fresh mint, to garnish

## Instructions

1. Brew butterfly pea flower tea per package directions; cool to room temperature (or chill in the fridge).
2. Stir honey into the passion fruit juice until dissolved. Chill.
3. Fill two tall glasses with ice.
4. Pour the passion fruit mixture over the ice (about ¼ cup per glass).
5. Slowly pour the ginger beer over the back of a spoon so it floats on top.
6. Gently pour the butterfly pea flower tea last — it will create a dramatic blue layer.
7. Add a squeeze of lime juice (this turns the blue tea purple where it meets the acid). Garnish and serve immediately without stirring, then let guests mix their own.

## Notes

- The colour-change reaction from lime juice is the showstopper — pour it table-side for effect.
- Butterfly pea flower tea is widely available dried online or at specialty tea shops.
- For an alcoholic version, add 1 oz white rum or vodka with the passion fruit juice.
