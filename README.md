Letting AI make up recipes

## Want to see a recipe?

Have a dish in mind that you'd love to see AI attempt to explain or create? **Open a GitHub issue!**

Anyone with a GitHub account can submit a recipe request. Just [open a new issue](../../issues/new) and describe the recipe you'd like us to try — get as creative or as weird as you want.

We'll use any leftover GitHub Actions / premium requests to tackle the most upvoted recipes. So if you see a request you love, give it a 👍 to help it rise to the top!

## Folder Structure

All recipes live inside the [`recipes/`](recipes/) directory and are organised by food type:

```
recipes/
├── appetizers/                  # Starters, snacks, and small bites
├── soups-and-stews/             # Broths, chowders, bisques, and hearty stews
├── salads/                      # Green salads, grain salads, composed salads
├── main-courses/                # Entrées by protein or dietary preference
│   ├── beef/
│   ├── chicken/
│   ├── pork/
│   ├── seafood/
│   ├── vegetarian/
│   └── pasta/
├── side-dishes/                 # Vegetables, grains, and accompaniments
├── breads-and-baked-goods/      # Loaves, rolls, muffins, flatbreads
├── desserts/                    # Cakes, cookies, pastries, frozen treats
├── drinks-and-beverages/        # Cocktails, mocktails, smoothies, hot drinks
└── sauces-and-condiments/       # Sauces, dressings, dips, and spreads
```

Each recipe is a Markdown file named after the dish (e.g., `smoky-ember-chili.md`). See [`recipes/README.md`](recipes/README.md) for the full recipe template.
