Letting AI make up recipes

## Want to see a recipe?

Have a dish in mind that you'd love to see AI attempt to explain or create? **Open a GitHub issue!**

Anyone with a GitHub account can submit a recipe request. Just [open a new issue](../../issues/new) and describe the recipe you'd like us to try — get as creative or as weird as you want.

We'll use any leftover GitHub Actions / premium requests to tackle the most upvoted recipes. So if you see a request you love, give it a 👍 to help it rise to the top!
